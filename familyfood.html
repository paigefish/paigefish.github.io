										<h2>Family and Food</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I chose to make this website about food not only because I love exploring new restaurants and experiencing new cultures, but it has brought my family closer together. </p>

											<h3>Traditions</h3>
											<p>My great grandma past down the tradition of baking. We make specific foods that take a long time to make. I enjoy baking days with my grandma and mom because it is a way for us to stay connected and I know that I will pass these traditions to the next generation.</p>

											<h3>Holidays</h3>
											<p>Food is the center for every holiday get together. The first question is what's the food situation. I love being able to go home for the holidays now because the food is always amazing. I can't wait to finally go home for Thanksgiving!</p>

											<h3>Sports</h3>
											<p>My dad loved playing sports as a kid and wanted my brother and I to learn to like football. To this day, we will get food like wings to watch a Seahawks game. While they aren't very good now and my brother and I are away at college, its nice to come back and enjoy this time. </p>

											<h3>Daily Routine</h3>
											<p>Growing up my parents always made it a priority for us to have family dinner. Ever since I can remember every night we would sit at the table and talk about our day. It wasn't until I got older when I realized how special this time was because not all families do it.</p>
