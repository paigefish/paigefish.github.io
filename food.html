										<h1>Seattle Food</h1>
										<h2>My Favorite Restuarant</h2>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>One of my favorite restaurants is a place called Caf√© Lago. It is a small italian place about a 20 minute drive from my house. I love this restuarant because it has my favorite lasagna. I am not the type of person who has a lot of favorites but this place is one I always look forward to go to. </p>
									<p>I have been coming to this place over the years. As a kid, I didn't think much of it because it is a slightly nicer restuarant so we only go on special occasions. It wasn't until I got older when I realized that I loved the vibe and the food.</p>
									<p>Now, ever since I have been coming to Ohio for school, my parents always make a reservation for some point when I am home. I only go home for winter, summer and sometimes Thanksgiving, so I have enjoyed creating memories throughout the years at this place with my family. I can't wait to go back for my birthday over Thanksgiving break!</p>

									<h2>Beechers</h2>
									<p>Unless you are from Seattle, most likely you have never heard of this place. It is known for cheese and has amazing grilled cheese sandwiches and mac and cheese. My mom would buy the frozen mac and cheese from the grocery store and it would be so good.</p>
									<p>They do have a location at Pike Place Market, where if you go at the right time, you can see them making cheese in the window. It's cool, but I haven't been there in a long time. They have another location in the Seattle airport and whenever we fly somewhere, this is what we get. It is like a little taste of home before I leave for school. </p>

									<h2>Hello Robin</h2>
									<p>You may think this is just trying to say hello to someone named Robin, but I don't have any friends named Robin. Instead, its a place that makes only tasty cookies. The parking to get there is horrible, but in the summer they have Molly Moons ice cream and you can get a ice cream sandwich.</p>
									<p>My favorite cookie is called Macklesmore which of course has a Seattle touch. (Macklemore is in Seattle) Anyways, it is a chocolate chip cookie with marshmallow with a piece of melted chocolate on top with the entire cookie on top of a graham cracker. It's so good and I haven't been there in so long. I always end up going last minute if I am in the area and forget to use a gift card I got years ago. I don't know if the card would still work, but I really should do that. </p>
