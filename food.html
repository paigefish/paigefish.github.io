										<h1>My Favorite Restuarant</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>One of my favorite restaurants is a place called Caf√© Lago. It is a small italian place about a 20 minute drive from my house. I love this restuarant because it has my favorite lasagna. I am not the type of person who has a lot of favorites but this place is one I always look forward to going. </p>
									<p>I have been coming to this place as I have grown up. As a kid, I didn't think much of it because it is a slightly nicer restuarant so we only go on special occasions. It wasn't until I got older when I realized that I loved the vibe and the food.</p>
									<p>Now, ever since I have been coming to Ohio for school, my parents always make a reservation for some point when I am home. I only go home for winter, summer and sometimes Thanksgiving, so I have enjoyed creating memories throughout the years at this place with my family. I can't wait to go back for my birthday over Thanksgiving break!</p>

									<h2>Beechers</h2>
									<p>I have grown up in a family with the motto family is food and food is family. Whenever, we get together, there is always food involved. Especially, I love when I come home to my mom's cooking. Whether its just family dinner with the four of us or a big family gathering, she always makes food that tastes amazing. I love when she makes her small homemade chicken pot pies or her sticky chicken wings.</p>
									<p>Addintionally, I huge tradition that is being past down is baking. We have some small pastries that we make that take a long time and we typically only make once a year. I was lucky enough to get to know my great grandmother who lived till she was 97 and didn't pass away until I was around 17. I learned my baking skills from her and to this day, I still bake with my mom and grandma when I can at home.</p>
