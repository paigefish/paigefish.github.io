										<h1>Spain Food</h1>
									</header>

									<p>So, I realized that when I was finding pictures, that they are all from my travels from being abroad. The food was amazing! Also, writing this made me super hungry!</p>

									<h2>Patatas Bravas</h2>
									
									<p>This was my favorite dish that I had while studying abroad. It is a typical Spain dish that they have at every restaurant. They do tapas which are like small appetizers. This was my favorite because this restuarant called Tribuna was a local hidden gem. The portions were bigger and this dish only cost around 2.5 euros. When my mom came to visit at the end, this was the main place I took her too. The waiters did not know English, so it was amazing to truly find a local spot with no tourists.</p>

									<h2>Tostada con Tomate</h2>
									<p>This is a typical Spain breakfast. It is toast with a tomato spread and Iberico ham and a coffee. My favorite time was being able to sit outside and enjoy this. It was nice because this would only cost me a euro or two, so I ate this a lot. There were a few restaurants right across from my university, so I would eat this with friends before or between classes. I am also do not typically like ham, but this was an exception for sure.</p>

									<h2>Montaditos</h2>
									<p>Montaditos means small sandwiches and these are super common too. There is a restaurant called 100 Montaditos which had 100 types and this was a good lunch when I wanted something a little more filling. It came with free chips and I loved being able to try different types.</p>

									<h2>Paella</h2>
									<p>I had paella a few times while abroad in both Sevilla and Madrid. I also took two paella cooking classes with my programs. We made seafood paella and this photo is when the paella is cooking from my class in Madrid. It is meant to be eaten during lunch and is suppose to be shared with others. It comes in a big dish and is meant to celebrate special occasions. </p>

									  <h2>Ice cream</h2>
									  <p>This was a time when I had to try a touristy place. They served ice cream cones in the shape of flowers. It would melt very fast, but it was cool to see them make the flower so quickly. The ice cream didn't taste like anything special though.</p>
